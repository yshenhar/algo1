</p><p><b> How do I read input directly from a file, without redirecting standard input?</b>
Use the <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/stdlib/javadoc/In.html">In data type</a>.
(See pp. 82-83 of the textbook for more details.)

</p><p><b> Can I read the synset or hypernym file twice?</b>
No, file I/O is very expensive so 
please read each file only once and store it in an appropriate data structure.

</p><p><b>Any advice on how to read in and parse the synset and hypernym data files?</b>
Use the <tt>readLine()</tt> method in our <tt>In</tt> library to read
in the data one line at a time.
Use the <tt>split()</tt> method in Java's <tt>String</tt> library
to divide a line into fields. You can find an example using <tt>split()</tt> in 
<a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/25applications/Domain.java.html">Domain.java</a>.
Use <tt>Integer.parseInt()</tt> 
to convert string id numbers into integers.

</p><p><b>What assumption can I make about the digraph G passed to the SAP constructor?</b>
It can be any digraph, not necessarily a DAG.


</p><p><b>What data structure(s) should I use to store the synsets, synset ids, and hypernyms?</b>
This part of the assignment is up to you. You must carefully select data structures
to achieve the specified performance requirements.

</p><p><b>Do I need to store the glosses?</b>
No, you won't use them on this assignment.

</p><p><b>Can I use my own Digraph class?</b>
No, it must have the same API as our
<a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42directed/Digraph.java.html">Digraph.java</a>
class; otherwise, you are changing the API to the SAP constructor (which takes a 
<tt>Digraph</tt> argument). Do not submit <tt>Digraph.java</tt>.

</p><p><b>Should I re-implement breadth-first search in my SAP class?</b>
No, you should call the relevant method(s) in
<a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42directed/BreadthFirstDirectedPaths.java.html">BreadthFirstDirectedPaths.java</a>.
You may modify <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42directed/BreadthFirstDirectedPaths.java.html">BreadthFirstDirectedPaths.java</a>
to optimize your code, but if you do so, rename it,
say to <tt>DeluxeBFS.java</tt>, and submit it.

</p><p><b> I understand how to compute the <tt>length(int v, int w)</tt> method
in time proportional to <em>E</em> + <em>V</em>
but my <tt>length(Iterable&lt;Integer&gt; v, Iterable&lt;Integer&gt; w)</tt>
method takes time proportional to <em>a</em> × <em>b</em> × (<em>E</em> + <em>V</em>),
where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are the sizes of the two iterables. How can
I improve it to be proportional to <em>E</em> + <em>V</em>?</b>
The key is using the constructor in <tt>BreadthFirstDirectedPaths</tt> that 
takes an iterable of sources instead of using a single source.


</p><p><b>Is a vertex considered an ancestor of itself?</b>
Yes.

</p><p><b>What is the root synset for the WordNet DAG?</b>

</p><blockquote><pre>38003,entity,that which is perceived or known or inferred to have its own distinct existence (living or nonliving)  
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>Can a noun appear in more than one synset?</b>
Absolutely. It will appear once for each meaning that the noun has.
For example, here are all of the entries in <tt>synsets.txt</tt>
that include the noun <tt>word</tt>.

</p><blockquote><pre>35532,discussion give-and-take word,an exchange of views on some topic; "we had a good discussion"; "we had a word or two about it"
56587,news intelligence tidings word,new information about specific and timely events; "they awaited news of the outcome"
59267,parole word word_of_honor,a promise; "he gave his word"
59465,password watchword word parole countersign,a secret word or phrase known only to a restricted group; "he forgot the password"
81575,word,a word is a string of bits stored in computer memory; "large computers use words up to 64 bits long"
81576,word,a verbal command for action; "when I give the word  charge!"
81577,word,a brief statement; "he didn't say a word about it"
81578,word,a unit of language that native speakers can identify; "words are the blocks from which sentences are made"; "he hardly said ten words all morning"
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>Can a synset consist of exactly one noun?</b>
Yes. Moreover, there can be several different synsets that consist of the same noun.

</p><blockquote><pre>62,Aberdeen,a town in western Washington  
63,Aberdeen,a town in northeastern South Dakota  
64,Aberdeen,a town in northeastern Maryland  
65,Aberdeen,a city in northeastern Scotland on the North Sea  
</pre></blockquote>

<!--
<p><b>Can two synsets have identical glosses?</b>
Yes. In such cases, <tt>glosses()</tt> should include a copy of each.

<blockquote><pre>
23104,barley barleycorn,a grain of barley  
23108,barleycorn,a grain of barley  
</pre></blockquote>


<p><b>Some of the glosses have example sentences at the end. What is this?</b>
The example sentence is considered to be part of the gloss.
You shouldn't need to do anything special to handle it.
-->

<p><b>I'm an ontologist and I noticed that your 
<tt>hypernyms.txt</tt> file contains both <em>is-a</em> and
<em>is-instance-of</em> relationships.</b>
Yes, you caught us. This ensures that every noun (except entity)
has a hypernym. Here is an article on the 
<a href="http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/checklists/wordnet-instances.pdf">subtle distinction</a>.

<!--
<p><b>In WordNet, what should <tt>glosses()</tt> do if the input argument
is not a wordnet noun?</b>
Return an <tt>Iterable&lt;String&gt;</tt> that has zero elements.
-->

</p><p><b>How can I make SAP immutable?</b>
You can (and should) save the associated digraph in an instance variable.
However, because our <tt>Digraph</tt> data type is mutable,
you must first make a defensive copy by calling the copy constructor.

</p><p><b>Some examples.</b>
Here are some interesting examples that you can use in your code.

</p><ul>

<p></p><li>The synset <tt>municipality</tt> has two paths to <tt>region</tt>.
<blockquote><pre>municipality -&gt; administrative_district -&gt; district -&gt; region
municipality -&gt; populated_area-&gt; geographic_area -&gt; region
</pre></blockquote>

<p></p></li><li> The synsets <tt>individual</tt> and <tt>edible_fruit</tt>
have several different paths to their common ancestor
<tt>physical_entity</tt>.
    
<blockquote><pre>individual -&gt; organism being -&gt; living_thing animate_thing -&gt; whole unit -&gt; object physical_object -&gt; physical_entity
person individual someone somebody mortal soul -&gt; causal_agent cause causal_agency -&gt; physical_entity
edible_fruit -&gt; garden_truck -&gt; food solid_food -&gt; solid -&gt; matter -&gt; physical_entity
edible_fruit -&gt; fruit -&gt; reproductive_structure -&gt; plant_organ -&gt; plant_part -&gt; natural_object -&gt; unit -&gt; object -&gt; physica
</pre></blockquote>


<p></p></li><li> The following pairs of nouns are very far apart:
<blockquote><pre>33 = distance("Black_Plague", "black_marlin")
27 = distance ("American_water_spaniel", "histology")
29 = distance("Brown_Swiss", "barrel_roll")
</pre></blockquote>

</li><li> The following synset has many ancestors and paths to <tt>entity</tt>.
<blockquote><pre>Ambrose Saint_Ambrose St._Ambrose
</pre></blockquote>

</li></ul>

<p><b>Timing.</b>
In the "Optimizations" section below, we provide some tricks to speed up
the running time by several orders of magnitude. But, don't try to implement
these until you have a working nonoptimized solution.

</p><p><b>DrJava.</b>
We do not recommend that you run your program on large inputs in DrJava—instead,
use the command line.

</p><p>

</p><ul>

<p></p><li>
The directory
<a href="http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/wordnet/">wordnet</a>
contains some sample input files.
For convenience, <a href="http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/wordnet-testing.zip">wordnet-testing.zip</a>
contains all of these files bundled together.

<p></p></li><li>
Create the data type <tt>SAP</tt>.
First, think carefully about designing a correct and efficient
algorithm for computing the shortest ancestral path.
Ask in the Discussion Forums if you're unsure.
In addition to the <tt>digraph*.txt</tt> files, 
design small DAGs to test and debug your code.

<p></p></li><li>
Read in and parse the files described in the assignment, <tt>synsets.txt</tt> 
and <tt>hypernyms.txt</tt>.
Don't worry about storing the data in any data structures yet.
Test that you are parsing the input correctly before proceeding.

<p></p></li><li>
Create a data type <tt>WordNet</tt>. Divide the constructor into 
two subtasks.
<ul>
<p></p><li> Read in the <tt>synsets.txt</tt> file and build
appropriate data structures.

<p></p></li><li> Read in the <tt>hypernyms.txt</tt> file and build a
<tt>Digraph</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you read in <tt>synsets.txt</tt> first, you can identify the largest id
before constructing the <tt>Digraph</tt>.
Check that it is 82,191 but do not hardwire this number into your
program because your program must work with any valid input file.

<!--
<p><li> Add the method <tt>isNoun()</tt> and <tt>glosses()</tt>.
If you chose appropriate data structures when parsing
<tt>synsets.txt</tt>, this step will be relatively easy.

<p>
Try some nouns that participate in many synsets, e.g., <tt>run</tt>, <tt>face</tt> and 
<tt>back</tt>.

</p><p>
There are a few things you can do to <em>significantly</em>
speed up a sequence of SAP computations on
the same digraph.

</p><ul>
<p></p><li> The bottleneck operation is reinitializing arrays of length <em>V</em> to
perform the BFS computations. This must be done once for the first BFS computation,
but if you keep track of which array entries change, you can reuse the same 
array from computation to computation (reinitializing only those
entries that changed in the previous computation).
This leads to a dramatic savings when only a small number of entries change
(which is the typical case for the wordnet digraph).
Note that if you have any other loops that iterates through all of the vertices,
then you must eliminate those loops too in order to achieve a sublinear running time.

<p></p></li><li> If you run the breadth-first searches from <em>v</em> and <em>w</em> simultaneously,
then you can terminate the BFS from <em>v</em> (or <em>w</em>) as soon as the distance exceeds
the length of the best ancestral path found so far.

<p></p></li><li> Implement a software cache of recently computed <tt>length()</tt> and
<tt>ancestor()</tt> queries. Often, a client calls <tt>ancestor()</tt> immediately
after calling <tt>length()</tt> or vice versa.
